# HandCalculator
A console calculator in Java that shows work and can handle almost inifinite equations.


How is this possible?
HandCalculator does its work exactly like humans do it. This includes borrowing from other digits in subtraction and
passing over remainders.


Supported equations
x*x - Multiplication
x+x - Addition
x-x - Subtraction
x^x - To The Power's
x/x - Coming Soon...

HandCalculator is one of the few calculators in the world that will be able to do almost infinite equations.

What do you mean by almost infinite?

This calculator can go up to 21 million times bigger than a Googol. A Googol is 1 followed by 100 zeros. 
So the amount of digits HandCalculator can support is 2,147,483,647 digits. This means 
a 1 followed by 2,147,483,646 digits while showing all the work it did. Your computer would crash before hitting that.

Common mistake:
People think HandCalculator only supports up to 2 billion.
That's incorrect, HandCalculator supports up to 2 billion digits.
